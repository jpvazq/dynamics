In this project, a 1 DOF model of the mechanism responsible for transmitting wheel movements to the shock absorber of the ART-24D vehicle will be studied. 
The rocker is the component that transmits the load from the wheels to the shock absorbers, allowing them to perform their function. 
A detailed representation in Catia V5 R20 is made, conducting a kinematic and dynamic analysis of the system's movement, studying possible singular configurations and the optimal transmission angle via Matlab.

Run the main code in "matlabcode" which calls all the other functions, change the main parameters to adapt it to your model
